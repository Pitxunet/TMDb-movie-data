# TMDb-movie-data
Second project in Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree, investigating a dataset
In this project I analyzed a movie dataset with over 10000 movies and then communicated my findings. I used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib.
I did some basic cleaning of the dataset and used what I had just learned about exploratory analysis.
